======

For a quick start follow the instructions below. For more in depth information on why and how we build Faro, the [wiki](https://github.com/icapps/ios-faro/wiki) page.

## Concept
We build a service request by using a `Bar` class as the point where you fire your `Order` and get a `Result`. 

## Get Served

Take a look at the `BarSpec`, in short:

```swift

```

## Write unit tests
In the example project you can find examples written with `Nimbel` for both CoreData and others.

## Requirements

- iOS 8 or higher
- Because we use generics you can only use this pod in Swift only files. You can mix and Match with Objective-C but not with generic classes.
