# AirRivet

For quick start follow the instructions below. For more in dept info on why and how we build this AirRivet stuff you are more then welcome on the [wiki](https://github.com/icapps/ios-air-rivet/wiki)

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

1. Create a Model object that complies to protocol `BaseModel`
2. Create a class that complies to `Environment`
3. Do a request like:

### Swift
```swift
import AirRivet

do {
	try Air.retrieve({ (response) in
	print(response)
})
}catch {
	print("ðŸ’£Error with request construction: \(error)ðŸ’£")
}
```
### Objective-C
```objective-C
/**
 In build settings look at the Module Identifier. This is the one you should use to import swift files from the same target.
 */
#import "AirRivet_Example-Swift.h"

GameScoreController * controller = [[GameScoreController alloc] init];

[controller retrieve:^(NSArray<GameScore *> * _Nonnull response) {
	NSLog(@"%@", response);
} failure:^(NSError * _Nonnull error) {
	NSLog(@"%@", error);
}];

@end
```
> *See "(project root)/Example" *
