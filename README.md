======

For a quick start follow the instructions below. For more in depth information on why and how we build Faro, the [wiki](https://github.com/icapps/ios-faro/wiki) page.

## Concept
We build a service request by using a `Service` class as the point where you fire your `Call` and get a `Result`.

### features

*Service*
* Service written to use Swift without Objective-C
* Service cleanly incapsulates all the parameters to handle a netowerk request
* Easily write a 'MockService' to load JSON from a local drive

*Automagically Parse*
* Automatic Serialization and Mapping thanks to the use off the Swift 'Mirror' class.
* Uses Protocol extensions to minimize the work needed on your end üòé
* Because we use Protocols you can use any type including CoreData `NSManagedObject` üí™üèº

## Perform a Call

Take a look at the `ServiceSpec`, in short:
```swift
        let service = Service(configuration: Configuration(baseURL: "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com")
        let call = Call(path: "posts")

        service.perform(call) { (result: Result<Posts>) in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                switch result {
                case .models(let model):
                    print("üéâ \(model)")
                default:
                    print("üí£ fail")
                }
            }
        })
```
## Parsing results

Parsing and Serialization can happen automagically. Best is to take a look at `ParseableSpec`. A typical `Parseable` Type looks like:

### Type without relations

```swift
class Foo: Parseable {
  var uuid: String?
  var blue: String?

  required init?(from raw: Any) {
      map(from: raw)
  }

  var mappers: [String : ((Any?)->())] {
      return ["uuid" : {self.uuid <- $0 },
              "blue" : {self.blue <- $0 }]
  }

}
```

### Type with relations
```swift
class Foo: Parseable {
  var uuid: String?
  var blue: String?
  var fooRelation: FooRelation?
  var relations: [FooRelation]?

  required init?(from raw: Any) {
      map(from: raw)
  }

  var mappers: [String : ((Any?)->())] {
      return ["uuid" : {self.uuid <- $0 },
              "blue" : {self.blue <- $0 },
              "fooRelation": {self.fooRelation = FooRelation(from: $0)},
              "relations": addRelations()
              ]
  }

  private func addRelations() -> (Any?)->() {
      return {[unowned self] in
          self.relations = extractRelations(from: $0)
      }
  }

}
```

## Requirements

- iOS 8 or higher
- Because we use generics you can only use this pod in Swift only files. You can mix and Match with Objective-C but not with generic classes.

## Installation

Faro is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) and the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

To install it with CocoaPods, add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Faro"
```
