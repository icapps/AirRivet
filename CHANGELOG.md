# Faro

## Version 3.0.1
* Improved documentation about inner throwing functions by pointing to blog https://appventure.me/2015/06/19/swift-try-catch-asynchronous-closures/

## Version 3.0

Swift 4.0 and `JSONDeserialisable` is removed in favor of `Decodable`

Unfortunately it was not possible to make this version backwards compatible.

What will you get if you switch:

* Faro contains less code
* Do not write any parsing code thanks to Apple's `Decodable`
* Retry mechanism that actually works
* Easily let all your request continue in the background

---

## Version 2.2
!! Warning minor breaking change !!

* If you use `HTTPURLResponseRetryable` you should implement the protocol again. Data and error are added as parameters.

## Version 2.1.0
* added ability to use a body with urlComponents encoding

**WARNING**

Breaks because of rename `Parameter.urlComponents` to `Parameter.urlComponentsInBody`

## Version 2.0.13
* fixes bug with force unwrapping in create functions

## Version 2.0.12
* Parameter booleans and values added to inspect a Parameters

## Version 2.0.11
* Errors printed with end of lines

## Version 2.0.10
* call public

## Version 2.0.9
* Fixes crash with json that could not be pretty printed.

## Version 2.0.8
* Better errors for JSONAdaptor

## Version 2.0.7
* integrate fix from 1.0.11

## Version 2.0.5 & 2.0.6
* Array's or Set's of `RawRepresentable`'s can be parsed by create functions
* Array's or Set's of primitive types

## Version 2.0.4
* removed redundant prints for `DeprecatedService`

## Version 2.0.2 & 2.0.3
Minor fix to Readme file

## Version 2.0.1

* You can now do a multipart post
* Removed `Deserializable` in favor of `JSONDeserialisable`
  * it appeared to difficult ot maintain both as in version 2.0
* Removed `Updateable` in favor of `JSONUpdateable`
  * it was difficult to maintain both

How to migrate:
* Comming from 1.0.0
  * Change all instances that implement `Deserializable` to `JSONDeserialisable`
  * Rename `init?(from raw: Any)` to `init(_ raw: [String: Any]) throws`
  * Handle throws instead of nil where you used the previous init
    * hint: If you do not want to handle the throws in old code that react to nil you can `let model = try? Foo()`
  * Change all instances that implement `Updateable` to `JSONUpdateable`
* Comming from 2.0.0
  * remove all `init?(from raw: Any)` and `Deserializable`

## Version 2.0.0

* Attempt to make error more descriptive
* Removed confusing Perform functions and added 2 functions `single...` `collection`
* Made it more descriptive that a request does not expect a json response.
* Moved away from result Enmum in favor of throws

*! Warning this is a breaking change*

* Parse functions
  * `parse(.. rename` -> `create(...`
* Operator rename:
  * DeserializeOperators `<->` to `|<`
  * SerializeOperators `<->` to `<|`
* Operators on models require the model to adopt 'Updatable'
  * This is done so it is more clear we create a new instance or update an existing one.

### Service has been deprecated
How to migrate:
* Original `Service` class is renamed to `DeprecatedService` and tagged. Rename all instances you have of Service to `DeprecatedService`
* Use the new `Service` for any new request you make.

### Deserialisable and Serialisable
We favor the use of `JSONDeserialisable` and `JSONSerialisable`
How to migrate:

* For new requests that use the new `Service` use `JSONDeserialisable` and `JSONSerialisable`
* `Deserialisable and `Serialisable` will still be available in the future as we might implement a more parsing from XML

### Result to DeprecatedResult

`DeprecatedService` still uses DeprecatedResult.
How to migrate:

* New requests should use the new `Result`
* Old request should rename `Result` to `DeprecatedResult`

### FaroService renamed to FaroSingelton
You can still use a singleton but the confusing name FaroService is now gone
How to migrate:

* Rename FaroService to FaroDeprecatedSingleton
* For new projects use FaroSingelton

## Version 1.0.0
* Convenience methods that do not use a switch as a result

### **WARNING**
Version 1.0.0 is not compatible with 0.7.2. All the functions, classes, protocols, ... that we no longer support have been marked with a ```@available(*, deprecated=1.0.0, message="use the Bar class")``` attribute.

In the previous versions to fire a service request you used the `Air` class. Now you should use the `Service` class.

* First implementation after major changes (read more in the ReadMe)

* CoreDataPopulatedSqlite now throws when you forget to add a sqlite file to the application bundle
*
## Version 0.5.12

## Version 0.5.11
* fixes and documentation for core data unit tests

## Version 0.5.10
* renames in core data

## Version 0.5.9
* made stuff public

## Version 0.5.8

## Version 0.5.7
* fixed crash in unique lookup

## Version 0.5.6
* Fix a bug when buiding for watchOS.

## Version 0.5.5
* Added support for OS X, watchOS and tvOS.

## Version 0.5.4
* Added transformer that can store JSON files
* Update unit test imports
* Updated ReadMe

## Version 0.5.3
* Added utility function to fetch unique entities from core data

## Version 0.5.0
* Added support for CoreData
* Mitigator Example with a non printing Version
* Introduced MapError

## Version 0.4.3
* Usable with CoreData. Unfortunately we have to expose some of the CoreData internals in AirRivet. Otherwise Rivetable instances would not be testable.

## Version 0.4.2
* We initialized a lot. This was due to an override problem with static methods. This has now been fixed. The TransformController is the only object responsible of initializing instances
* `Parsable` protocol now has a throwable initializer. This is to make it possible to use the protocol for `NSManagedObject` subclasses.


## Version 0.4.1

* Made function on TransformController public that we could use to intercept the data before it is mapped to the object.

## Version 0.3.0

* Add a Swift package.
* Use CocoaPods version 1.0.
