import Foundation
/*:
 This sesssion sets itself as the URLSessionDelegate. This is done so thissession singleton can all check all responses of tasks before the closure to report to the service is called.

 After the response is checked  the closures you provide on a Service that uses this session are called. This is all very abract but this is done for the following reasons:

 1. If one of the tasks responds with a authentication problem that would result in an error for all other ongoing concurent tasks then those tasks are paused until the authentication problem is fixed
 2. In case of a retry only one retry request is fired and other tasks are suspended. Not using a single session would make writing that code difficult.
 3. If you like you can easily write a general error handler that checks all repsonses before the closures of the service are called. Just subclass and override the delegate function you need.

     This is an important method that can be used in many cases:

        1. If you require to monitor every task completion before going to the result
        2. In case of an invalid token that needs a retry.

     - Parameters:
         - retryCheck: check if this request indicates you should fire a retry, for example on statusCode == 401
         - fixCancelledRequest: You should make these request valid again. For example replace a token in the header and return the fixed request.
         - performRetry: In this asynchronous call you should do your retry task and call done when finished. Return the retry task immediattally so we do not cancel it. All other tasks on this session are suspended until you call done.
     After done we call fixCancelledRequest so you can fix the requests. When that is done all requests are fired again.
